# Example Data Directory

This directory contains example CSV files that serve as templates for the minimum amount of information needed for their respective use case. These CSV files are designed to help you understand the required structure and content for your metadata files.

## Files

- `biosample_creation_required_info.csv`: This file contains the basic template for the REQUIRED columns needed when generating new Biosample IDs.
- `quantity_value.csv`: This file contains the fields that are included in QuanityValue type slots. Examples of this slot include air_temp, samp_size, and phosphate. There are no required fields for this value type. This csv includes all available options for this slot type, but they can be included/excluded as needed. The important aspect in this example is the dot notation for included QuanityValue fields.
- `enum_slot_example`: This file contains an example of Enum type slots. These are not complicated slots (note they still have 'biosample.' notation), but the values MUST be one of the permissible values as [defined in the NMDC Schema](https://microbiomedata.github.io/nmdc-schema/).
- `config_example.toml`: This file is used to demonstrate the format of a toml file that holds credentials. The credential variables must follow the nomenclature in this file. If using `env` variables, the contents of the file will be same.
- `sample_metadata_with_urls.csv`: This file demonstrates the new URL functionality, showing how to include sample-specific URLs for raw and processed data files using `raw_data_url` and `processed_data_url` columns.

## New URL Functionality

You can now include sample-specific URLs in your metadata files using these optional columns:

- `raw_data_url` - Complete URL for the raw data file
- `processed_data_url` - Complete URL for the processed data file

When these columns are present, they take precedence over the base URLs provided via CLI arguments. This allows different samples to point to different data repositories or storage locations.

## Usage

1. Use these tempaltes in your generation and workflow scripts. Ensure the output matches these.
3. Ensure that all mandatory fields are completed.
4. For URL functionality, either provide base URLs via CLI arguments OR include URL columns in your metadata file.

## Notes

- Please do not modify the column headers in the templates. If headers are different, metdata generation will not be accurate.
**Ensure that the data format matches the examples provided in the templates.**
- If you have any questions or need further assistance, please contact the contributors of this repository.

Thank you for using our templates to ensure consistent and accurate data submissions.
